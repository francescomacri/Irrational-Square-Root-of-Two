\section{Historical Notes}
The ancient Greeks, the Pythagoreans, studied prime numbers, progressions, and those ratios and proportions, but in contrast to our current understanding, a ratio of two whole numbers was not a fraction, i. e. a distinct kind of number with respect to the whole numbers \cite[32]{klineMathematicalThoughtAncient1990}.
The own discovery of the role of whole numbers in musical harmony inspired Pythagoreans to seek whole-number patterns everywhere \cite[11]{stillwellMathematicsItsHistory2010}.
If quantities could have been measured by a common unit using whole numbers, they had a common measure and where called \emph{com-mensurable} \cite[32]{klineMathematicalThoughtAncient1990}.
The discovery of ratios that were not measurable in this way, i. e. that where \emph{in-commensurable}, is attrubuted to \textsc{Hippasus of Metapontum} \cite[32]{klineMathematicalThoughtAncient1990}, and was a turning point in Greek mathematics \cite[1]{stillwellStoryProofLogic2022}. Furthermore, it has affected mathematics and philisophy from the time of the Greeks to the present day \cite[59]{courantWhatMathematicsElementary1996} and it is assumed that it marked the origin of what these days is considered the Greek contribution to rigorous procedure in mathematics \cite[59]{courantWhatMathematicsElementary1996}, \cite[1]{stillwellStoryProofLogic2022}.
The starting point was the Pythagorean theorem, that was discovered indipendently in several ancient cultures \cite[3]{stillwellStoryProofLogic2022}.
There is evidence \cite[4]{stillwellMathematicsItsHistory2010} that the Babylonians (1800 BC), the Chinese (between 200 and 220 BC) and Indian (between 500 and 200 BC) mathematicians were interested in triangles whose sides where whole-number triples that - denoted in modern way - satisfy the equation \(a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}\) \cite[3-4]{stillwellStoryProofLogic2022} such as for instance the following ones, that today we call \emph{Pythagorean triples} \cite[4]{stillwellMathematicsItsHistory2010}, e. g. \(\langle 3, 4, 5 \rangle, \langle 5, 12, 13 \rangle, \langle 8, 15, 17 \rangle\):
\begin{align*}
     & 3^{2} + 4^{2}  =  5^{2}  = 9 + 16 = 25,     \\
     & 5^{2} + 12^{2} =  13^{2}  = 25 + 144 = 169, \\
     & 8^{2} + 15^{2} = 17^{2} = 64 + 225 = 289.
\end{align*}
But it is assumed, that only the Pythagoreans were interested in a special case that eventually led to the discovery of the \emph{incommensurable} ratios: Given that two sides of the right-angled triangle are \(a = b\); the crucial question - again, denoted in the modern way - must have been whether there are whole numbers \(a\) and \(c\) that satisfy the equation:
\begin{equation}
    c^{2} = 2a^{2},
\end{equation}
fulfilling \emph{commensurability} \cite[6-7]{stillwellStoryProofLogic2022}, \cite[58]{courantWhatMathematicsElementary1996}. \\

\section{Theorem and Proof}
% Theorem
\begin{theorem}
    The square root of 2 is irrational.
\end{theorem}
% Proof
\begin{proof}
    We suppose that the square root of \(2\) is rational.
    By definition, a number belongs to the set of the rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\), if it can be expressed as a ratio of two integers  \(\frac{p}{q}\), where the numerator p can be any integer and the denominator q must be a non-zero integer.

    If the square root of \(2\) is rational, then it can be expressed as the ratio of two integers p and q, where p and q have no common factor other than \(1\):
    \begin{equation}\label{1.1}
        \sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2} = \frac{p}{q}.
    \end{equation}
    Now we square both sides of the equation (\ref{1.1}). On the left-hand side (LHS) it gives:
    \begin{equation}\label{1.2}
        \left(2^{1/2}\right)^{2} = 2^{2/2} = 2 =,
    \end{equation}
    whereas on the right-hand side (RHS) it gives:
    \begin{equation}\label{1.3}
        = \left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{2} = \frac{p^2}{q^2}.
    \end{equation}
    That is:
    \begin{equation}\label{1.4}
        2 = \frac{p^2}{q^2},
    \end{equation}
    which by basic algebra can be rearranged into:
    \begin{equation}\label{1.5}
        p^{2} = 2q^{2}.
    \end{equation}
    Now, by definition of an even integer, that has the form \((2 \cdot \text{an integer}\)), the RHS, i. e. \(2q^{2}\) is an even integer. It follows that also the LHS, that is \(p^{2}\) must be even. This leads us to the question of whether \(p\) is also even.
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % Proof that if s^{2} is even, also s is even. 
    \begin{proposition}\label{2.1}
        For every integer \(s\), if \(s^{2}\) is even then \(s\) is even.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose \(s\) is any odd integer. Then, by the definition of an odd integer, \(s = 2k + 1\) for some integer k. By substitution and basic algebra, we get:
        \begin{equation}
            s^{2} = (2k + 1)^{2} = 4k^{2} + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^{2} + 2k) + 1.
        \end{equation}
        If we add or multiply integers toghether, the resulting sum or product will still be in the same set \(\mathbb{Z}\), i. e. it is an integer. This is referred to as the closure property of addition and multiplication which holds within the set of integers. Due to these properties, the expression \(2k^{2} + 2k\) must be an integer. We will denote it as \(L = 2k^{2} + 2k\). Hence, also \(s^{2} = 2 \cdot L + 1\) is an integer, and by the definition of an odd integer, \(s^{2}\) is odd.
    \end{proof}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    Now we know, that also \(p\) must be even. And by definition of an even integer, we also deduce that:
    \begin{equation}\label{1.6}
        p = 2r \qquad \text{for some integer} \; r.
    \end{equation}
    Now, by substitution, we insert into equation (\ref{1.5}) what we got in equation (\ref{1.6}), and we see that:
    \begin{equation}\label{1.7}
        p^{2} = (2r)^{2} = 4r^{2} = 2q^{2}.
    \end{equation}
    By dividing both, \(4r^{2}\) and \(2q^{2}\) by \(2\), we get:
    \begin{equation}\label{1.8}
        2r^{2} = q^{2}.
    \end{equation}
    As we can see, by the definition of an even integer, \(q^{2}\) is even, and by proposition (\ref{2.1}) also q is even. But earlier, we deduced from (\ref{1.5}) that \(p\) is even. And this would mean, that both \(p\) and \(q\) are even, and that they have the common factor \(2\). But this contradicts the supposition, that p and q do not have a common factor, other than 1. Hence, the supposition is false and the theorem, which states that the square root of 2 cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, is true, which means that it is irrational.
\end{proof}
