macro:->Please
note,
that
whereas
the
top
number
of
the
fraction,
that
is
the
numerator,
can
be
\(0\),
because
\(0\)
divided
by
\(1\)
as
in
the
example
above
is
still
\(0\),
the
bottom
number
of
the
fraction,
namely
the
denominator,
cannot
have
the
value
\(0\),
because
if
we
assume
that
the
quotient
of
such
a
fraction
would
be
\(q
=
\frac
{a}{0}\),
then
by
basic
algebra
we
would
get
\(q
\cdot
0
=
a\),
and
hence,
by
the
fact
that
multiplying
any
number
with
\(0\)
gives
always
\(0\),
we
get
\(0
=
a\).
But
this
would
also
mean
that
in
theory
we
could
insert
as
\(q\)
any
number,
which
would
lead
to
\(1
\cdot
0
=
0
\cdot
0,
2
\cdot
0
=
0
\cdot
0,
3
\cdot
0
=
0
\cdot
0,
\dots
\).
If
we
would
now
cancel
out
\(0\)
on
the
left-hand
side
(LHS)
and
on
the
right-hand
side
(RHS),
we
would
get
obviously
wrong
results
such
as
\(1
=
0,
2
=
0,
3
=
0,
\dots
\).
This
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
is
not
allowed
to
have
a
denominator
with
the
value
\(0\).
